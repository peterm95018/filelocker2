# Shibbolizing Filelocker2.6

This fork is our attempt to Shibbolize the Filelocker2 app. We based our approach on the WebSSO diffs found in the Sourceforge issues for Filelocker. We did not implement all of those changes since they appear to have been written for 2.4. We simply hunted for the code in the refactored 2.6 version and then applied the bare minimum to get us through the SAML authentication process.
